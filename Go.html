                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code defines a function 'SplitChunks' that takes a slice of integers 'data' and an integer 'chunkSize' as input. It initializes an empty slice 'chunks' that will hold the split chunks. The function iterates through the input slice in steps of 'chunkSize' and creates smaller slices of 'chunkSize' elements using slicing. The smaller slices are appended to the 'chunks' slice, representing the split chunks. The function then returns the 'chunks' slice, containing the smaller slices of the original data.</p>

In this example, the function splits the slice [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] into chunks of size 3, resulting in [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9] [10]].

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code defines a function 'QuickSort' that takes a slice 'arr' of integers as input and implements the Quick Sort algorithm to sort the elements of the slice in ascending order. The function uses recursion to sort the slice by dividing it into smaller sub-slices and then combining them. The 'if' statement checks if the length of the slice is 1 or less, and if so, it returns the slice as it is already sorted. If the slice has more than one element, the function selects a pivot element from the middle of the slice. It then creates three empty slices 'left', 'right', and 'equal', and iterates through the elements of the input slice. Depending on whether an element is less than, equal to, or greater than the pivot, it appends the element to the corresponding slice. The 'left' and 'right' sub-slices are recursively sorted using Quick Sort by calling the 'QuickSort' function on them. Finally, the 'left', 'equal', and 'right' sub-slices are combined and returned as the sorted slice. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'QuickSort' function to sort a given slice of integers and prints the unsorted and sorted slices.</p>

The function first checks if the input slice is empty, and if so, it returns 0.0 to avoid a divide-by-zero error. It then initializes a variable 'sum' to store the sum of all the elements in the slice. The 'for' loop iterates through the slice using 'range', and for each element 'num' in the slice, it adds 'num' to the 'sum'. After calculating the sum, the function calculates the average by dividing the 'sum' by the number of elements in the slice (converted to float64 to preserve decimal precision). The 'average' variable holds the calculated average, which is then returned by the function. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'CalculateAverage' function to find the average of a given slice of numbers and prints the result with two decimal places.</p>

                                    <li>The deferred function calls are executed in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order, meaning the most recently deferred function will be executed first.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Defer is often used to handle resource cleanup, such as closing files or releasing locks, ensuring that these tasks are performed even in the case of an early return or an error.</li>

                                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
                                    <li>Deferred function calls are executed even if a panic occurs within the surrounding function, allowing for cleanup before the program terminates.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Defer can also be used to improve code readability by postponing the execution of certain operations until the end of the function, making the code flow more explicit.</li>

The function first creates an empty map 'mergedMap' using the 'make' function to initialize it. It then uses a loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of 'map1' and adds each key-value pair to 'mergedMap'. After that, it does the same for 'map2'. The merging process ensures that if a key already exists in the destination 'mergedMap', the value will be overwritten with the new value from 'map1' or 'map2'. If a key does not exist in the destination 'mergedMap', it will be added with its corresponding value from 'map1' or 'map2'. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'MergeMaps' function to merge two maps 'map1' and 'map2' and prints the resulting 'mergedMap'.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code demonstrates how Go uses interfaces for polymorphism. It defines an interface 'Shape' with a single method 'Area()' that returns a float64. Two structs 'Rectangle' and 'Circle' implement the 'Shape' interface by providing their own implementations of the 'Area()' method. The 'printArea' function takes a 'Shape' interface as an argument and prints the area of any shape. In the 'main' function, two different shapes (a 'Rectangle' and a 'Circle') are assigned to the 'Shape' interface variable 'shape', and the 'printArea' function is called to print the area of both shapes. This demonstrates how the same function can work with different types that implement the same interface, achieving polymorphism in Go.</p>

The first value of the assignment is ignored (denoted by the underscore '_') as we are only interested in the existence of the key. The second value of the assignment 'exists' will be true if the 'key' exists in the map; otherwise, it will be false. The function returns 'exists', indicating whether the 'key' exists in the map or not.

                                    <li>In Go, interfaces play a significant role in achieving 'run-time' polymorphism.

                                <li>Real-time polymorphism is commonly used in Go when working with multiple functions that have different parameter types but provide similar functionality.

                                <li>Run-time polymorphism is frequently used in Go when dealing with different implementations of an interface. The specific method implementation is resolved dynamically at run-time based on the actual type of the object assigned to the interface variable.</li>
                                
                                <li>In practice, 'run-time' polymorphism allows Go programs to extend functionality by adding new types that satisfy existing interfaces, promoting code reusability and maintaining a clear contract for required behavior.</li>

The function uses bitwise XOR operations to achieve the swap without a temporary variable. Inside the function, 'a' is updated to 'a ^ b', 'b' is updated to 'a ^ b', and finally, 'a' is updated to 'a ^ b', resulting in the swapped values. In the 'main' function, two variables 'a' and 'b' are initialized to 10 and 20, respectively. The 'SwapNumbers' function is then called with these variables, and their swapped values are printed to the console.</p>

The function uses nested 'for' loops to traverse the rows and columns of the 2D slice. For each element in the 2D slice, it uses 'fmt.Printf' to print the value followed by a space. After printing all elements in a row, it uses 'fmt.Println' to move to the next row and create a new line. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'Print2DSlice' function to print a sample 2D slice 'twoD' containing the numbers from 1 to 9 in a 3x3 grid.</p>

The function handles the special case of an empty slice by returning a value of 0. For non-empty slices, the function initializes a variable 'min' to the maximum possible integer value using 'math.MaxInt64'. It then iterates through the slice using a 'for' loop, comparing each element with the 'min'. If an element is smaller than the 'min', the 'min' is updated to the element's value. After traversing the entire slice, the function returns the 'min', which represents the minimum value in the slice.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code demonstrates the definition and implementation of an interface in Go. It defines an interface 'Shape' with a single method signature 'Area()' that returns a float64. It also defines two structs 'Rectangle' and 'Circle'. Both 'Rectangle' and 'Circle' implement the 'Area()' method, implicitly satisfying the 'Shape' interface. In the 'main' function, a 'Shape' variable 'shape' is created, and it is assigned instances of 'Rectangle' and 'Circle'. The code then prints the area of the 'Rectangle' and the 'Circle' using the 'Area()' method.</p>

                                <li>Interfaces are commonly used in Go to define generic behaviors that can be implemented by different types. For example, a 'Shape' interface can define a method 'Area()' that calculates the area, and various shapes like 'Rectangle' and 'Circle' can implement the 'Shape' interface.</li>
                                
                                <li>Interfaces allow for loosely coupled code. For instance, code that operates on a 'Writer' interface does not need to know the specific underlying type, as long as it satisfies the 'Write()' method signature.</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code defines a function 'BubbleSort' that takes a slice 'slice' of integers as input and performs the bubble sort algorithm on the slice, sorting the elements in ascending order. The function uses a 'for' loop to repeat the sorting process until no swaps are made in a pass, indicating that the slice is sorted. In each pass, the 'for' loop iterates through the slice from index 1 to n (length of the unsorted portion). If an adjacent pair of elements is out of order (larger element before the smaller element), they are swapped. The 'swapped' variable is used to track whether any swaps were made in the current pass. After each pass, the length of the unsorted portion 'n' is decremented, as the largest element is guaranteed to be in the correct position at the end of the slice. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'BubbleSort' function to sort a given slice of integers and prints the result before and after sorting.</p>

                                <li>A common use case for closures is creating callbacks. You can define a closure that captures some local state and pass it as a callback function to another function.

                                <li>Closures are also used for managing state in functional options patterns, where you can customize the behavior of a function or method by passing it closures that define specific configuration options.</li>

                                    <li>Buffered channels, on the other hand, have a fixed capacity greater than 0. They can hold multiple values up to their capacity without blocking the sending Goroutine until the buffer is full.</li>

                                    <li>For unbuffered channels, sender and receiver Goroutines must be ready to communicate simultaneously. This creates a synchronous and blocking communication between Goroutines.</li>

                                <li>Unbuffered channels are commonly used for synchronous communication, ensuring a direct and immediate exchange of data between Goroutines, ideal for critical operations that require immediate synchronization.</li>
                                
                                <li>Buffered channels are useful in scenarios where Goroutines need to communicate without direct synchronization, allowing a certain degree of decoupling between senders and receivers, which can be beneficial for performance optimization.</li>
                                
                                <li>In a producer-consumer pattern, a buffered channel can be used to decouple the production rate from the consumption rate, allowing smoother communication and reducing contention between producers and consumers.</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code demonstrates polymorphism in Go using interfaces. It defines an interface 'Shape' with a single method 'Area()' that returns a float64. Two structs 'Rectangle' and 'Circle' implement the 'Shape' interface. The 'printArea' function takes a 'Shape' interface as an argument and prints the area of any shape. In the 'main' function, two different shapes (a 'Rectangle' and a 'Circle') are assigned to the 'Shape' interface variable 'shape', and the 'printArea' function is called to print the area of both shapes. This demonstrates how the same function can work with different types that implement the same interface, achieving polymorphism in Go.</p>

                                <li>Here's an example of variable shadowing in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var x = 10 // Outer variable

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Outer x:", x)

    if true {
        var x = 5 // Inner variable (shadowing the outer variable)
        fmt.Println("Inner x:", x)
    }

    fmt.Println("Outer x after inner scope:", x)
}
```

Output:
```
Outer x: 10
Inner x: 5
Outer x after inner scope: 10
```

In this example, the inner variable 'x' shadows the outer variable 'x' within the if block. The inner variable 'x' is only accessible within the if block, and references to 'x' inside the block refer to the inner variable, while the outer variable 'x' remains unaffected.</li>
                                
                                <li>Shadowing can be used intentionally to create a new variable with the same name as an existing variable in a specific scope, without affecting the outer variable. It can help in simplifying code and avoiding naming conflicts.</li>

The function initializes an empty slice 'fibSeries' to store the Fibonacci numbers. It also initializes two variables 'prev' and 'curr' with 0 and 1, respectively. The function then uses a for loop to calculate each Fibonacci number up to 'num' and appends it to the 'fibSeries' slice. In each iteration, 'curr' stores the next Fibonacci number, and 'prev' stores the previous Fibonacci number. The loop continues until 'curr' exceeds 'num'. Finally, the 'fibSeries' slice containing the Fibonacci numbers is returned.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code defines a struct 'Stack' that represents a stack data structure with an integer slice 'data' to store the elements. The stack has three methods: 'Push', 'Pop', and 'Size'. The 'Push' method appends the 'item' to the 'data' slice using the 'append' function. The 'Pop' method checks if the 'data' slice is empty. If it is not, it retrieves the top element, removes it from the slice, and returns the element along with 'true'. If the 'data' slice is empty, it returns '0' and 'false' to indicate that the stack is empty. The 'Size' method simply returns the length of the 'data' slice to represent the size of the stack. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'Stack' struct to create a stack, perform push and pop operations, and print the size of the stack at different stages.</p>

The function uses 'start' and 'end' variables to define the boundaries of the current search range. The search begins with 'start' at the beginning of the slice and 'end' at the end of the slice. In each iteration of the loop, the middle index is calculated using the formula (start + end) / 2. If the middle element is equal to the target, the function returns its index. If the middle element is greater than the target, the search continues in the left half of the slice by updating 'end' to 'middle - 1'. If the middle element is less than the target, the search continues in the right half of the slice by updating 'start' to 'middle + 1'. This process continues until the target element is found, and its index is returned, or the search range cannot be further divided, and -1 is returned to indicate that the target element is not in the slice. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'BinarySearch' function to search for the target element 11 in a sorted slice of integers.</p>

The function first checks the dimensions of the input matrices to ensure they can be multiplied. It then initializes an empty matrix 'result' with dimensions (m x n), where m is the number of rows in the first matrix and n is the number of columns in the second matrix. It uses nested 'for' loops to iterate through the elements of the matrices and perform the multiplication and addition operations as required for matrix multiplication. The 'result' matrix holds the resulting matrix after completing the multiplication. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'MatrixMultiplication' function to perform matrix multiplication on two given matrices and prints the input matrices and the resulting matrix.</p>

The function splits the IP string by periods using 'strings.Split' and ensures that there are exactly four parts in the split string. Then, it iterates through each part, converts it to an integer using 'strconv.Atoi', and checks if the resulting integer is within the valid range of 0 to 255.

If the underlying value of 'data' is of type 'int', it prints that it is an integer along with the value. If the underlying value is of type 'string', it prints that it is a string along with the value. For any other type, it prints 'Unknown data type'.</p>

The function first checks if the input number is positive and non-zero because negative numbers and zero do not have meaningful digit sums. It then initializes the 'sum' variable to 0 to accumulate the digit values. The function uses a loop to extract the rightmost digit of 'num' using the modulus operator (%) and accumulates its value to 'sum'. It then removes the rightmost digit from 'num' using the division operator (/) in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until 'num' becomes 0, and the function returns the final 'sum' of the digits. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'SumOfDigits' function to find the sum of digits for the number 12345.</p>

                                <li>Here's an example of using pointers with a struct in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Point struct {
    X int
    Y int
}

func main() {
    p := Point{X: 10, Y: 5}
    fmt.Println("Before: ", p)

    modifyPoint(&p)
    fmt.Println("After: ", p)
}

func modifyPoint(point *Point) {
    point.X = 20
    point.Y = 15
}
```

Output:
```
Before:  {10 5}
After:  {20 15}
```

In this example, we define a Point struct with two fields, X and Y. We then create a pointer to a Point struct and pass it to the 'modifyPoint' function, where we modify the values of X and Y using the pointer. The changes made to the struct inside the function are reflected in the original struct 'p' in the main function.</li>
                                
                                <li>Using pointers with structs is common in scenarios where you want to update the original struct in a function or method and avoid unnecessary copying of data.</li>

                                    <li>The general syntax of the 'switch' statement is:

```go
switch expression {
  case value1:
    // code to execute when expression equals value1
  case value2:
    // code to execute when expression equals value2
  // ...
  default:
    // code to execute when none of the cases match
}
```</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
                                    <li>The 'switch' statement evaluates the expression and compares its value with the values listed in each 'case' block. If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the switch exits. If none of the cases match, the code inside the 'default' block (if present) is executed.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
                                    <li>Unlike some other programming languages, Go does not fall through the 'case' blocks, meaning it does not continue to execute the following 'case' blocks after a match. This behavior helps in writing safer and more predictable code.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <li>The 'switch' statement is often used to handle different input options or user choices, such as menu selections or command-line arguments, and execute the corresponding actions accordingly.</li>
                                
                                <li>In algorithms that involve multiple cases, such as handling different types of errors or status codes, the 'switch' statement simplifies and organizes the code, improving readability and maintainability.</li>
                                
                                <li>The 'switch' statement can be used in combination with the 'fallthrough' keyword when specific cases need to share common code. However, this should be used with caution, as it can make the code less clear and harder to follow.</li>

The function first removes all non-alphanumeric characters (such as spaces and punctuation) from the string and converts it to lowercase using the 'unicode' package for case-insensitive comparison. It then initializes an empty rune slice 'filtered' to store the filtered characters. The function uses a 'for' loop to iterate through each character of the filtered string and appends only alphanumeric characters to the 'filtered' slice. After filtering, the length of the 'filtered' slice is calculated. The function then uses another 'for' loop to compare characters from both ends of the 'filtered' slice to check for a palindrome. If any pair of characters from the beginning and the end does not match, the function returns 'false', indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If all character pairs match, the function returns 'true', indicating that the string is a palindrome.</p>

The function first checks if the length of the slice is less than 2. If it is, the function immediately returns 'true' since a slice with one or zero elements is considered sorted. If the slice has two or more elements, the function uses a 'for' loop to iterate through the slice starting from index 1. In each iteration, it compares the current element 'arr[i]' with the previous element 'arr[i-1]'. If 'arr[i]' is less than 'arr[i-1]', it means the slice is not sorted in ascending order, and the function returns 'false'. If the 'for' loop completes without returning 'false', it means the slice is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns 'true'. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'IsSliceAscending' function to check whether two given slices, 'slice1' and 'slice2', are sorted in ascending order and prints the results accordingly.</p>

The function uses a sliding window approach to find the substring. It maintains a map 'charMap' to track characters and their last occurrence index in the string. The 'start' pointer represents the left boundary of the window, and the 'end' pointer iterates through the string to expand the window. If a repeating character is found within the window, the 'start' pointer moves to the right until the repeating character is no longer in the window. The function keeps track of the maximum length of the non-repeating substring ('maxLen') and the starting index of the longest substring ('maxStart'). Finally, it returns the longest non-repeating substring using slicing based on the 'maxStart' and 'maxLen' indices. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'LongestNonRepeatingSubstring' function to find the longest non-repeating substring of the given input string 'input' and prints the result.</p>

                                <li>When working with asynchronous operations like timers or event handlers, closures can be used to capture and maintain the state or context of the operation, enabling the callback functions to access the necessary variables.</li>
                                
                                <li>In cases where encapsulation is required, closures can be used to define private functions that have access to private variables, ensuring that the internal state is hidden and protected.</li>

If any character is not a digit, the function immediately returns 'false', indicating that the string contains non-digit characters. If all characters are digits, the function returns 'true', indicating that the string contains only digits. The 'main' function demonstrates how to use the 'ContainsOnlyDigits' function to check whether the given input string 'input' contains only digits and prints the result accordingly.</p>

The function initializes an empty map 'frequency' using the 'make' function. It then iterates through the slice using a 'for' loop and 'range'. For each element 'num' in the slice, it updates the corresponding count in the 'frequency' map by incrementing the value associated with the key 'num'.

It uses the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm to efficiently find the majority element. The function initializes 'candidate' as -1 and 'count' as 0. It then iterates through the input slice. If 'count' becomes 0, the 'candidate' is updated to the current number. For each subsequent number, the function increments 'count' if it matches the 'candidate' or decrements 'count' otherwise. After the iteration, 'candidate' will hold the potential majority element. The function then verifies if the candidate appears more than 'len(nums)/2' times and returns the result.</p>

                                    <li>Type assertion is commonly used when working with interface types, as it allows you to access the concrete value and methods of an interface.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>The syntax for type assertion is 'value.(Type)', where 'value' is the interface variable, and 'Type' is the desired underlying type.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>If the type assertion is successful and the value is of the specified type, the underlying value is returned along with a 'true' boolean flag. Otherwise, it returns a zero value and 'false' flag.</li>

                                    <li>To handle the possibility of an unsuccessful type assertion, you can use an 'if' statement with the comma-ok idiom or the 'switch' statement to handle different types.</li>
