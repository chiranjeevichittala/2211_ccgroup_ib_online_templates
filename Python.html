                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code provides an example implementation to create and use the Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure. It defines a class 'TrieNode' that represents a node in the trie. Each node has a dictionary 'children' to store its child nodes and a boolean 'is_word' to indicate if the node represents the end of a word. The code also defines a class 'Trie' that represents the data structure. The 'Trie' class has a root node and provides methods 'insert' to insert a word into the trie and 'search' to check if a word exists in the trie. The code includes a test case to demonstrate the usage of the data structure.</p>

If a character is not present in the current node's dictionary, a new nested dictionary is created for that character. The '$' key is used to indicate the end of a word. The 'search' method searches for a word in the trie by iterating over each character and traversing the trie. If a character is not found in the current node's dictionary, the search fails. If the search reaches the end of the word and the '$' key is present in the last node, the search succeeds.

It defines a function 'solve_nqueens' that takes the board size as input and returns a valid placement of queens. The implementation uses a recursive approach with two helper functions. The 'is_safe' function checks if it is safe to place a queen at a particular position on the board. It checks the column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal for any existing queens. The 'solve_util' function is a backtracking algorithm that explores all possible placements of queens. It iterates through the columns and tries to place a queen in each row. If a valid placement is found, it recursively calls itself for the next column. If a solution is found, it returns True. The 'solve_nqueens' function initializes the board, calls 'solve_util' with the initial column, and returns the board if a solution exists. Finally, the implementation is tested by providing the board size and printing the board if a solution is found; otherwise, it prints a message indicating no solution exists.</p>

It defines a function 'prim' that takes the input graph and the starting vertex as input. It initializes an empty list 'mst' to store the nodes of the MST. It also initializes a dictionary 'visited' to keep track of visited nodes and a dictionary 'distances' to store the distances from the starting vertex to each node. The distances are initialized to infinity except for the starting vertex, which is set to 0. The algorithm then iteratively selects the node with the minimum distance among the unvisited nodes and adds it to the MST. It updates the distances of the neighboring nodes if a shorter distance is found. The process continues until all nodes are visited. Finally, it returns the MST.

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code provides an example implementation to solve the Maximum Flow problem using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. It defines a function 'maximum_flow' that takes the graph, source, and sink as input. The implementation is left empty as it depends on the specific graph representation and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm implementation. The function should implement the necessary steps to find the maximum flow using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or a related approach. Finally, it returns the maximum flow value. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code defines a function 'reverse_string' that takes a string 's' as input and recursively reverses it. The base case checks if the length of the string is less than or equal to 1. If so, the function returns the string as is. Otherwise, it calls itself with the substring starting from the second character (index 1) and concatenates the first character (index 0) at the end. This process is repeated recursively until the entire string is reversed. The function is then tested by providing a sample string and printing the reversed string.</p>

It initializes the base case where the target sum is 0, which is possible with an empty subset. Then, it iterates over the array and target sum in a bottom-up manner, considering each number and the possibility of including it in the subset. If the current number is smaller or equal to the target sum, the value is determined by the OR operation between two subproblems: (1) not including the current number and checking the previous subset, and (2) including the current number and checking the remaining sum after subtracting the current number. Finally, it returns the value for the complete array and target sum. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

The 'insert' method inserts a key-value pair into the hash table. If the key already exists in the bucket, its value is updated. The 'get' method retrieves the value associated with a given key from the hash table. If the key is not found, it raises a 'KeyError' exception.

We first handle the edge case where the array is empty. In that case, we return 0 since there are no elements in the array. Otherwise, we initialize a list `lengths` with 1 for each index, representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that index. We iterate over the elements of the array using a `for` loop. For each element at index `i`, we iterate over the previous elements using a nested `for` loop. If the current element is greater than the previous element at index `j`, we update the length at index `i` to the maximum value between the current length at index `i` and the length at index `j` plus 1. This step ensures that we consider all possible increasing subsequences.

The algorithm iteratively selects the node with the smallest distance, relaxes its neighbors, and continues until all nodes have been visited.

It defines a function 'pancake_sort' that takes the input array as input. The implementation follows the steps of Pancake Sort, which involves flipping subarrays to sort the elements. The code uses a loop to iterate through the array and find the index of the maximum element. If the maximum element is not already at the end of the array, it flips the subarray before the maximum element and then flips the entire subarray. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. Finally, it modifies the array in-place. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code demonstrates the usage of the "property" decorator in Python. The "Circle" class defines a radius attribute and uses the "property" decorator to create a getter, setter, and deleter method for the attribute. The getter retrieves the value of the radius, the setter validates and sets a new radius value, and the deleter deletes the radius attribute. The code showcases the usage of these methods to access and modify the radius attribute.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code provides an implementation of a circular linked list in Python. It defines a 'Node' class to represent a node in the list, which contains a data field and a 'next' pointer to the next node. The 'CircularLinkedList' class manages the list operations, including insertion and display. When inserting a new node, the 'insert' method checks if the list is empty. If so, it sets the new node as the head and links it to itself. Otherwise, it traverses the list to find the last node and appends the new node by updating the 'next' pointers. The 'display' method prints the data of each node in the circular linked list. The circular linked list is tested by creating an instance of the 'CircularLinkedList' class, inserting some data, and displaying the list.</p>

The algorithm then performs the main loop that considers each vertex as an intermediate vertex. Within this loop, it iterates over all pairs of vertices and updates the distances if a shorter path is found through the intermediate vertex. Finally, it returns the 'distances' matrix.

Each node has a 'value' attribute and left and right child pointers ('left' and 'right'). We also define three functions: 'serialize', 'deserialize', and 'deserialize_helper'. The 'serialize' function takes the root node as input and performs a pre-order traversal of the tree. It converts each node's value to a string and concatenates them with commas to form the serialized string representation. The 'deserialize' function takes the serialized string as input and splits it into a list of values. It then calls the 'deserialize_helper' function to reconstruct the binary tree from the list of values. The 'deserialize_helper' function recursively pops values from the list and constructs nodes with the appropriate values, left and right pointers. We create a binary tree, call the 'serialize' function to serialize it, print the serialized tree, call the 'deserialize' function to deserialize the string back into a binary tree, and print the deserialized tree.</p>

The child class named 'Child' inherits from the parent class and overrides the 'greeting' method. Inside the overridden method, the 'super().greeting()' line invokes the 'greeting' method from the parent class, and then the child class's specific behavior is added. When the 'greeting' method is called on an instance of the child class, both the parent and child greetings are printed, resulting in the output:

```
Hello from Parent class
Hello from Child class
```</p>

Starting from the given start vertex, it pops a vertex from the stack, checks if it has been visited, prints it if not, adds it to the visited set, and pushes its unvisited neighbors onto the stack. We create a graph, add edges, and perform DFS traversal from a specific vertex, printing the visited vertices.</p>

The class utilizes the 'heapq' module from the Python standard library, which provides functions for working with heaps. The priority queue is initialized as an empty list. The 'push' method takes an item and its priority as input and adds it to the heap using 'heappush' with the priority as the first element of the tuple. The 'pop' method removes and returns the item with the highest priority by using 'heappop' to retrieve the second element of the tuple. The 'is_empty' method checks if the heap is empty. The class is tested by creating an instance of 'PriorityQueue', pushing tasks with different priorities, and then popping and printing the tasks until the queue is empty.</p>

It defines a function 'longest_increasing_subsequence_length' that takes a sequence as input and returns the length of the LIS. The implementation uses an array 'dp' to store the lengths of the LIS for all elements in the sequence. It iterates through the elements and updates the array based on the increasing order of the elements. If an element is greater than a previous element, the length of the LIS is updated by taking the maximum of the current length and the length of the LIS obtained from the previous element plus one. Finally, the function returns the maximum length of the LIS. The implementation is tested by providing an example sequence and printing the length of the LIS.</p>

It starts by checking if the target element is present at the first index. If found, it returns the index. Otherwise, it iteratively doubles the index 'i' until it either exceeds the array length or finds an element greater than the target. Then, it calls the 'binary_search' function to perform a binary search within the identified range. The 'binary_search' function takes the subarray range, the target element, and performs the binary search algorithm. If the target element is found, it returns the index. If the target element is not found, both functions return -1. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

It initializes the base cases where the length of one string is 0, which requires the number of operations equal to the length of the other string. Then, it iterates over the substrings in a bottom-up manner, considering the characters at each position. If the characters match, no operation is needed, and the value is copied from the previous positions. Otherwise, the value is determined by taking the minimum from the three possible subproblems (substitution, insertion, or deletion) and adding 1.

Each node has a 'value' attribute to store the value and 'left' and 'right' attributes to reference the left and right child nodes, respectively. The function 'max_sum_path' takes the root node of the tree as input and uses a recursive approach to traverse all possible paths in the tree. During the traversal, it calculates the sum of each path and keeps track of the maximum sum encountered. The helper function 'traverse' performs the recursive traversal and calculates the sums of individual paths. At each node, it determines the maximum sum by considering the current node's value, the sums of the left and right subtrees (if positive), and the maximum sum encountered so far. The binary tree is created by instantiating the 'TreeNode' class and connecting the nodes accordingly. The function is then called to find the maximum sum path and print the result.</p>

The class has three methods: `__init__` to initialize the enqueue and dequeue stacks as empty lists, `enqueue` to add elements to the enqueue stack using the `append` method of lists, `dequeue` to remove and return the front element of the queue by transferring elements from the enqueue stack to the dequeue stack if necessary, and `is_empty` to check if the queue is empty by verifying that both the enqueue and dequeue stacks are empty. In the `dequeue` method, we first check if the queue is empty using the `is_empty` method. If the queue is not empty, we check if the dequeue stack is empty. If it is empty, we transfer elements from the enqueue stack to the dequeue stack by popping elements from the enqueue stack and appending them to the dequeue stack. This step ensures that the elements are in the correct order for dequeuing. Finally, we return the front element of the dequeue stack by popping it. If the queue is empty, we raise an exception indicating that the queue is empty. Finally, we demonstrate the queue operations by creating an instance of the `Queue` class, enqueueing three elements onto the queue, dequeuing the front element, and checking if the queue is empty.</p>

It defines a function 'topological_sort' that takes the input graph as input. It initializes a dictionary 'visited' to keep track of visited nodes and a list 'stack' to store the sorted nodes. The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to visit each node and its neighbors. It recursively explores the neighbors and then adds the current node to the stack. After visiting all nodes, the stack is reversed to obtain the topological sorting order. The function returns the reversed stack containing the sorted nodes. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

The 'Node' class represents each element in the linked list, storing the key-value pair and maintaining references to the previous and next nodes. The 'LRUCache' class represents the LRU cache data structure and has methods to perform cache operations such as 'get' and 'put'. The cache is implemented using a dictionary to provide constant time access to elements. The linked list maintains the order of recently used elements, with the most recently used element at the front and the least recently used element at the tail. When accessing or updating an element, it is moved to the front of the list. If the cache exceeds its capacity, the least recently used element (at the tail) is evicted. The cache is tested by creating an 'LRUCache' object, performing 'put' and 'get' operations, and printing the results.</p>

The "Date" class defines an alternative constructor using the "classmethod" decorator. The "from_string" method takes a date string in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format, converts it into year, month, and day values, and creates a new instance of the "Date" class using these values.

It initializes the base case where either string is empty, resulting in zero length. Then, it iterates over the characters of both strings in a bottom-up manner. If the characters at the current positions are equal, it updates the length of the common substring as the length of the substring without the current characters plus one.

Each time the generator is iterated, it yields the next even number from the sequence, suspending its execution until the next iteration.</p>

We initialize three pointers, 'i', 'j', and 'k', to track the current positions in each array. We iterate until any pointer reaches the end of its respective array. At each step, we compare the elements at the current positions of the pointers. If all three elements are equal, we have found a common element, so we append it to the 'common' list and advance all three pointers. If any element is smaller than the others, we advance the corresponding pointer. By repeating this process, we find all the common elements among the three arrays. Finally, we demonstrate the function by creating three example arrays, calling the function, and printing the result.</p>

The 'insert' method adds a new value to the heap and performs up-heapification to maintain the heap property. The 'extract_min' method removes and returns the minimum value by swapping it with the last element, popping it from the heap, and performing down-heapification. The 'is_empty' method checks if the heap is empty. The '_up_heapify' method performs up-heapification starting from the specified index. The '_down_heapify' method performs down-heapification starting from the specified index.

Each node has a 'value' attribute and left and right child pointers ('left' and 'right'). We also define two functions: 'find_lowest_common_ancestor' and 'find_path'. The 'find_lowest_common_ancestor' function takes the root node and two target nodes as input. It uses the 'find_path' function to find the paths from the root to each target node. It then iterates over the paths and finds the lowest common ancestor by comparing the nodes at each position. The 'find_path' function recursively searches for a target node starting from a given node and returns the path as a list of nodes. We create a binary tree, specify two target nodes, call the 'find_lowest_common_ancestor' function, and print the value of the lowest common ancestor.</p>

It defines a function 'min_number_of_coins' that takes the coin denominations, the target amount, and the available coins as input. The implementation uses a bottom-up approach with an array 'dp' to store the minimum number of coins required to make change for each amount from 0 to the target amount. It iterates over the coins and updates the values in 'dp' by considering the previous values and the current coin denomination. Finally, it returns the minimum number of coins for the target amount.

Each node has a 'value' attribute and left and right child pointers ('left' and 'right'). We also define two functions: 'find_diameter' and 'height'. The 'find_diameter' function calculates the diameter of the binary tree using a recursive approach. It recursively calculates the height of the left and right subtrees and finds the diameter of the left and right subtrees. The maximum of these values, along with the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees plus 1, gives the diameter of the binary tree. The 'height' function calculates the height of a given node using a similar recursive approach. We create a binary tree, call the 'find_diameter' function to find the diameter, and print the result.</p>

                                    <li>Implicit Invocation: Magic methods are invoked implicitly by Python in response to corresponding language-specific syntax or operations.</li>

                                <li>They enable classes to implement container types (e.g., lists, dictionaries) or context managers (e.g., using the "with" statement) by providing the necessary methods like "__len__", "__getitem__", "__setitem__", "__enter__", "__exit__", etc.</li>

We also define a function 'has_cycle' that takes the head of a linked list as input. The function uses the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to check if the linked list has a cycle. It initializes two pointers, 'slow' and 'fast', to the head of the linked list. The 'slow' pointer moves one step at a time, while the 'fast' pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the 'fast' pointer will eventually catch up to the 'slow' pointer. If the 'fast' pointer reaches the end of the linked list (i.e., 'fast' or 'fast.next' is 'None'), there is no cycle in the linked list. Finally, we demonstrate the function by creating a linked list with a cycle, calling the function, and printing the result.</p>

It defines a function 'bellman_ford' that takes the input graph and starting vertex as input. It initializes a dictionary 'distances' to store the shortest distances from the starting vertex to each vertex in the graph. Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the starting vertex, which is set to 0. It then performs the relaxation step, where it iterates len(graph) - 1 times and updates the distances if a shorter path is found. After the relaxation step, it checks for negative cycles by iterating over all edges and raising an error if a negative cycle is found. Finally, it returns the 'distances' dictionary. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

The "Point" class defines custom behavior for the addition operator (+) and equality operator (==) by implementing the "__add__" and "__eq__" special methods. The "__add__" method adds the x and y coordinates of two points to create a new point, while the "__eq__" method compares the x and y coordinates of two points for equality. The code shows how to use the custom operators with instances of the "Point" class.</p>

In the `pop` method, we first check if the stack is not empty using the `is_empty` method. If the stack is not empty, we remove and return the top element using the `pop` method. If the stack is empty, we raise an exception indicating that the stack is empty. Finally, we demonstrate the stack operations by creating an instance of the `Stack` class, pushing three elements onto the stack, popping the top element, and checking if the stack is empty.</p>

We merge the arrays by concatenating them using the `+` operator and sort the merged array using the `sorted` function. Next, we calculate the length of the merged array. If the length is even (determined by `n % 2 == 0`), we return the average of the two middle elements of the merged array. If the length is odd, we return the middle element. This approach works because merging the sorted arrays results in a sorted array, and the median of a sorted array can be calculated based on the length and parity. Finally, we demonstrate the function by creating two example arrays, calling the function, and printing the result.</p>

It defines a function 'matrix_chain_multiplication' that takes a list of matrix dimensions as input. The implementation uses a bottom-up approach with a 2D array 'dp' to store the minimum number of scalar multiplications required for each subchain of matrices. It initializes the base case where the chain length is 1, resulting in zero scalar multiplications. Then, it iterates over the chain lengths in a bottom-up manner, considering each possible split point. For each split point, it calculates the cost of multiplication by considering all possible split positions and selecting the one with the minimum cost. Finally, it returns the minimum number of scalar multiplications for the complete chain of matrices.

The filter() function is used to create an iterator containing only the even numbers from the list. The lambda function `lambda x: x % 2 == 0` takes an argument `x` and checks if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder, which indicates an even number. The filter() function applies the lambda function to each element of the list and collects the elements that satisfy the condition. Finally, the even numbers are converted to a list using the list() function and printed, resulting in the output `[2, 4]`.</p>

It defines a function 'coin_change' that takes the coin denominations and the target amount as input. The implementation uses a bottom-up approach with an array 'dp' to store the minimum number of coins required to make change for each amount from 0 to the target amount. It iterates over the coins and updates the values in 'dp' by considering the previous values and the current coin denomination. Finally, it returns the minimum number of coins for the target amount. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code provides an example implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using dynamic programming. The function 'tsp' takes a distance matrix and a starting city as input and returns the length of the shortest possible route that visits all cities and returns to the starting city. It includes a helper function 'generate_subsets' to generate all possible subsets of cities. The TSP is solved using dynamic programming by considering all possible subsets of cities. The code includes an example usage of the function.</p>

It defines a 'Node' class that represents each element in the linked list. Each node has a 'data' attribute to store the value and a 'next' attribute to refer to the next node in the list. The 'Queue' class represents the queue data structure and has methods to perform queue operations. The 'is_empty' method checks if the queue is empty. The 'enqueue' method adds a new element to the rear of the queue by creating a new node and updating the 'next' reference of the rear node. If the queue is empty, both the front and rear references are updated to the new node. The 'dequeue' method removes and returns the front element of the queue. It updates the front reference to the next node and checks if the queue becomes empty, in which case it updates the rear reference as well. The queue is tested by creating a 'Queue' object, enqueueing elements, and printing the elements using 'dequeue' operation until the queue becomes empty.</p>

We compare the middle element of the array with the target value. If they are equal, we return the middle index. If the middle element is less than the target value, we recursively call `binary_search` with the updated start index (`middle + 1`) and the same end index. If the middle element is greater than the target value, we recursively call `binary_search` with the same start index and the updated end index (`middle - 1`). Finally, outside the function, we declare an array `array` and assign it the sorted values [2, 4, 5, 6, 9]. We declare a target value `target` as 5. We call the `binary_search` function with the array, target, start index (0), and end index (len(array) - 1). We store the result in a variable `result` and print it.</p>

It initializes 'decimal' as 0 and 'power' as 0. It iterates over the digits of 'hexadecimal' in reverse order using 'hexadecimal[::-1]'. For each digit, it checks if it is a decimal digit (0-9) using the 'isdigit()' method. If it is a digit, it converts it to an integer and multiplies it by the corresponding power of 16, then adds it to 'decimal'. If it is not a digit, it converts it to uppercase using the 'upper()' method, subtracts the ASCII value of 'A', adds 10 to the result, and multiplies it by the corresponding power of 16. It increments 'power' by 1 in each iteration. Finally, it returns 'decimal' as the decimal representation. The function is tested by setting 'hexadecimal' to a specific value, calling 'hexadecimal_to_decimal' with this value, and printing the result.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code provides an example implementation to perform Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. It defines a function 'kruskal' that takes the input graph as input. It initializes an empty list 'edges' to store all the edges of the graph. It iterates over the graph and adds each edge to the 'edges' list along with its weight. The edges are then sorted in ascending order based on their weights. It also initializes an empty list 'mst' to store the edges of the MST and a dictionary 'disjoint_set' to represent the disjoint sets of vertices. The algorithm defines two helper functions 'find' and 'union' to perform the find and union operations of the disjoint sets. The algorithm then iterates over the sorted edges and checks if the endpoints of the edge belong to different disjoint sets. If they do, the edge is added to the MST, and the disjoint sets are merged using the 'union' operation. Finally, it returns the MST. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

Otherwise, the array is divided into two halves, 'left' and 'right', by finding the middle index.

It defines a function 'odd_even_sort' that takes the input array as input. The implementation follows the steps of Odd-Even Sort, which involves comparing and swapping elements in alternating odd and even positions. The code uses loops to iterate through the array and perform the swaps. It continues the sorting process until the array is sorted. Finally, it modifies the array in-place.

                                    <li>Static Method: The "staticmethod" decorator allows defining methods that are not bound to class or instance data.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Utility Methods: By using the "staticmethod" decorator, you can define utility methods that perform specific operations but do not rely on class-specific data.</li>

                                    <li>Class-Independent Invocation: Static methods can be called directly from the class or instances without requiring an instance-specific context.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Grouping Related Methods: The "staticmethod" decorator helps in organizing related utility methods within a class, improving code readability and maintainability.</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The code demonstrates the usage of the "staticmethod" decorator in Python. The "MathUtils" class defines static methods, such as "square" and "cube", using the "staticmethod" decorator. These methods perform mathematical calculations independently of any class or instance attributes. The code showcases the direct invocation of these methods from the class without requiring an instance.</p>

It uses several base cases and the recursive formula to handle different scenarios. If 'y' is 0, it returns 1 as the base case. If 'y' is negative, it returns 1 divided by the result of 'power_recursive' with 'x' and the negation of 'y'. If 'y' is even, it calculates 'power_recursive' with 'x' and 'y' divided by 2, squares the result, and returns it. Otherwise, it multiplies 'x' with 'power_recursive' of 'x' and 'y' decremented by 1. The function is tested by setting 'x' and 'y' to specific values, calling 'power_recursive' with these values, and printing the result.</p>

The class has a 'data' attribute to store the value and a 'next' attribute to reference the next node. We also define a function 'is_palindrome' that takes the head of the linked list as input. The function first checks if the linked list is empty or contains only one element, in which case it is considered a palindrome. Next, it uses two pointers, 'slow_ptr' and 'fast_ptr', to find the middle node of the linked list. The second half of the list starting from the middle node is then reversed using the 'prev', 'current', and 'next_node' pointers. The 'next' pointer of the middle node is updated to point to the reversed second half. Finally, the function compares the values of the nodes in the first half with the reversed second half. If any pair of nodes has different values, the function returns False indicating that the linked list is not a palindrome. If all pairs of nodes have the same values, the function returns True indicating that the linked list is a palindrome. We create a palindrome linked list, check if it is a palindrome, and print the result.</p>

The `name` attribute of `person1` is accessed and printed. The `eat` method is called on `person1`, and the `sleep` method is called on `person2`.

Each node has a 'value' attribute to store the value and 'left' and 'right' attributes to reference the left and right child nodes, respectively. The function 'kth_smallest_element' takes the root node of the tree and the value of 'k' as input. It performs an in-order traversal of the tree using a stack. During the traversal, it tracks the count of visited nodes using the 'k' variable. When 'k' becomes 0, it returns the value of the current node as the kth smallest element.

The `Node` class has two attributes: `data` to store the node value and `next` to store the reference to the next node. We also define a `LinkedList` class representing the linked list. The `LinkedList` class has a `head` attribute to store the reference to the first node. It has a `reverse` method to reverse the linked list using iteration. Inside the `reverse` method, we initialize `prev` to `None`, `current` to `self.head`, and `next_node` to the next node of `current`. We use a `while` loop to iterate over the nodes of the linked list. Inside the loop, we update the `next` reference of the current node to point to the previous node (`prev`). Then, we update `prev` to the current node and `current` to the next node. Finally, we update `self.head` to `prev` to make the last node the new head of the reversed linked list. After reversing the linked list, we print the data of each node in the reversed order by iterating over the linked list.</p>

Finally, we return `max_sum`, which represents the maximum sum of a subarray in the given array.</p>

We iterate over the characters of both strings using a `for` loop. For each character, we increment the count at the corresponding index using `ord(string[i]) - ord("a")`, where `ord` returns the Unicode code point of a character and `ord("a")` is subtracted to map the characters to indices 0 to 25. We decrement the count for the characters in `string2`. Finally, we use the `all` function to check if all values in `count` are zero, indicating that the frequency counts of each character are equal in both strings.

The 'Stack' class represents the stack data structure and has methods to perform stack operations. The 'is_empty' method checks if the stack is empty. The 'push' method adds a new element to the top of the stack by creating a new node and updating the 'next' reference. The 'pop' method removes and returns the top element of the stack.

The 'is_binary_search_tree' function takes the root node as input. It initializes an empty list 'values' and performs an inorder traversal of the tree using the 'inorder_traversal' function. The 'inorder_traversal' function recursively visits the left subtree, appends the value of the current node to the 'values' list, and then visits the right subtree. Finally, the 'is_binary_search_tree' function checks if the 'values' list is sorted in ascending order using the 'all' function and returns the result. We create a binary tree, call the 'is_binary_search_tree' function, and print the result.</p>

It defines a function 'longest_common_subsequence_length' that takes two strings as input and returns the length of the LCS. The implementation uses dynamic programming and creates a 2D array 'dp' to store the lengths of the LCS for all possible prefixes of the strings. It iterates through the strings and updates the values of 'dp' based on the matching characters. If two characters match, the length of the LCS is incremented by 1 compared to the previous prefixes. Otherwise, the length is determined by taking the maximum of the LCS lengths obtained from the previous prefixes. Finally, the function returns the length of the LCS. The implementation is tested by providing two example strings and printing the length of the LCS.</p>

It initializes the left and right pointers to the start and end indices of the array, respectively. In each iteration, it calculates the mid index as the average of left and right. If the element at the mid index is equal to the target, the function returns the mid index. If the target is greater than the element at the mid index, the left pointer is updated to mid + 1 to search in the right half of the array. If the target is less than the element at the mid index, the right pointer is updated to mid - 1 to search in the left half of the array. The process continues until the target is found or the search space is exhausted. If the target is not found, -1 is returned. The function is then tested by providing a sample array and target value and printing the result.</p>

It defines a function 'shortest_path' that takes the input graph, source node, and destination node as input. It initializes a dictionary 'distances' to store the shortest distances from the source node to each node in the graph. Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the source node, which is set to 0. It also initializes a priority queue 'priority_queue' using the 'heapq' module to store nodes with their corresponding distances. The algorithm continues until the priority queue is empty. In each iteration, it extracts the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue. If the extracted node is the destination node, it returns the shortest distance. Otherwise, it updates the distances to the neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found. Finally, if no path is found, it returns infinity. The code also includes a test case to showcase the usage of the function.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">In this code, we define a class 'Node' to represent a node in the linked list. The class has a 'data' attribute to store the value and a 'next' attribute to reference the next node. We also define a function 'merge_sorted_lists' that takes the heads of two sorted linked lists as input. The function creates a dummy node 'dummy' and a tail pointer 'tail' to keep track of the merged list. We compare the values of the nodes in the two lists and append the smaller value to the merged list by updating the 'next' pointer of the tail. We move the tail pointer and the corresponding pointer of the list from which the node was appended. We repeat this process until one of the lists is exhausted. Finally, we append the remaining nodes of the non-empty list to the merged list. We return the 'next' pointer of the dummy node as the head of the merged list. We create two sorted linked lists, merge them, and display the merged linked list.</p>
