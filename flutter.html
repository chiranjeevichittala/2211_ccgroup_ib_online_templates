                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code demonstrates the usage of a GlobalKey for form validation in Flutter. The '_formKey' is a GlobalKey instance of type 'GlobalKey&ltFormState&gt'. It's assigned to the 'key' property of the 'Form' widget. The 'TextFormField' widget inside the 'Form' uses the 'validator' callback to validate the input. The 'ElevatedButton' triggers form validation using '_formKey.currentState.validate()'. If the form is valid, a SnackBar is displayed. The GlobalKey ensures that the form's state can be accessed and manipulated from outside the widget tree.</p>

The 'ExpandableListScreen' class defines a list of 'ExpandableItem' objects, each containing a title and an 'isExpanded' property. The UI uses 'ListView.builder' to generate expansion tiles. Tapping on a tile toggles its expansion status. The 'ExpansionTile' widget is used to create expandable items with subitems. This example showcases how to create an expandable list in Flutter.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to create a horizontal scrolling list in Flutter using the 'ListView.builder' widget. The 'Container' limits the height to enable horizontal scrolling. The 'scrollDirection' is set to 'Axis.horizontal' to make the list scroll horizontally. The 'itemCount' defines the number of items in the list. The 'itemBuilder' generates each item with a 'Card' containing a 'Container' to display the item's content. You can customize the item appearance and layout according to your requirements.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code demonstrates how to use the 'http' package from pub.dev to make a GET request. The package is imported as 'http'. In the 'fetchData' method, 'http.get' is used to fetch data from the provided URL. The response is then printed to the console. The 'ElevatedButton' triggers the 'fetchData' method when pressed. This code snippet showcases the basic usage of the 'http' package for making network requests.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to handle file upload and download operations with Firebase Storage in Flutter. The 'FileUploadDownloadExample' widget includes buttons to upload and download files. The 'StorageUploadTask' is used to upload a file, and its progress is monitored using 'events'. The 'StorageUploadTask.onComplete' callback is used to handle successful uploads. For file download, the 'getData' method is used to retrieve the file data as a 'Uint8List'.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to implement infinite scrolling in a list with dynamically loaded content. The '_InfiniteScrollDemoState' class contains a list of data items and a 'ScrollController'. The 'initState' method adds a listener to the scroll controller to trigger data loading. When the user scrolls to the end of the list, new data is added, and a loading indicator is displayed. This example shows how to create an infinitely scrollable list in Flutter.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The above code demonstrates the usage of the BLoC pattern in Flutter. The 'CounterBloc' class manages the business logic of a counter. It exposes a stream of counter values that can be listened to by UI components. The 'MyHomePage' widget uses the 'StreamBuilder' widget to listen to the counter stream and display the counter value. When the 'FloatingActionButton' is pressed, it triggers the incrementCounter function in the BLoC, which updates the counter value and notifies the UI through the stream.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to implement a custom scrolling effect using ScrollPhysics in Flutter. The 'CustomScrollPhysics' class extends 'ScrollPhysics' and overrides 'applyPhysicsToUserOffset' to customize the scroll speed. In this example, the scroll speed is increased by a factor of 1.5. The 'CustomScrollExample' widget uses a 'SingleChildScrollView' with the custom physics to create the custom scrolling effect.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to implement search functionality with a search bar in Flutter. The 'SearchScreen' class contains a list of items and a '_searchQuery' to track the user's input. The 'filteredItems' getter filters the list based on the search query. The UI includes a search bar and a 'ListView.builder' to display the filtered results. When the user types in the search bar, the list updates dynamically to show matching items. This example showcases how to enable search and filtering in Flutter.</p>

                                    <li>In Flutter, encapsulation can be achieved through the use of classes and private members.</li>

                                    <li>1. **Classes:** Flutter uses classes to encapsulate UI components, data models, and more.</li>

                                    <li>2. **Private Members:** Dart allows you to mark members as private using the underscore (_) prefix. Private members can only be accessed within the same library.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>3. **Getters and Setters:** Flutter can provide controlled access to private members using getters and setters.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>4. **State Management:** In Flutter, different state management solutions like Provider, BLoC, and StatefulWidget enable effective encapsulation of state and UI logic.</li>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates a simple animation using the 'AnimationController', 'Tween', and 'AnimatedBuilder' widgets. The animation fades in a blue container. The 'AnimationController' is used to control the animation's duration and state. The 'Tween' defines the range of the animation. The 'AnimatedBuilder' rebuilds the UI on every animation value change. The 'Opacity' widget's opacity property is animated using the 'value' from the animation. The animation is triggered in the 'initState()' and disposed of in 'dispose()' to ensure proper cleanup.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to create a gesture responsive widget in Flutter. The 'GestureResponsiveWidget' class defines a 'GestureDetector' widget that responds to tap, double tap, and long press gestures. The widget contains a blue container with text. The gesture callbacks are defined to print messages when different gestures are detected. This example showcases how to create a gesture responsive widget in Flutter.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to implement a dark and light mode toggle in Flutter. The app's theme is controlled by the '_isDarkMode' boolean. The toggle button's value reflects the current mode and updates the state when toggled. The 'theme' property in 'MaterialApp' is set based on the '_isDarkMode'. The UI consists of a switch that toggles the theme between dark and light modes. Changing the theme dynamically using 'ThemeData' creates a smooth transition between the two modes.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to create a bottom navigation bar with tabs and corresponding views in Flutter. The '_BottomNavExampleState' class manages the selected tab index. The '_tabs' list contains the different tab views, and the 'IndexedStack' widget is used to display the currently selected tab's view. The 'BottomNavigationBar' widget contains the tab items, and the 'onTap' callback updates the selected tab index.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">The provided code demonstrates how to handle deep linking in a Flutter app. The 'MyApp' class defines the 'onGenerateRoute' callback to handle navigation based on deep links. If the route is '/', it navigates to the 'HomeScreen'. For other routes, you can implement your logic to handle deep linking and navigate to the appropriate screens. This example showcases how to handle deep linking and dynamic routing in Flutter.</p>
