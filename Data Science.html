                                    <li>Model Evaluation: The cost function measures the error or mismatch between the predicted values and the actual target values. It is a measure of how well the model is performing.</li>

                                    <li>Optimization: During the training process, the goal is to minimize the cost function. Optimization algorithms adjust the model's parameters to achieve this by finding the parameter values that lead to the lowest cost.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Decision Making: In some cases, the cost function is used to make decisions. For example, in logistic regression, the cost function helps in making binary classification decisions by comparing the predicted probabilities to a threshold.</li>

                                <li>In linear regression, the cost function is often the mean squared error (MSE), which quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Minimizing MSE leads to a best-fit linear model.</li>
                                
                                <li>In classification tasks, the cross-entropy loss is commonly used as a cost function. It measures the dissimilarity between predicted class probabilities and true class labels.</li>

                                    <li>R-squared (R2): R-squared is a metric that measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Adjusted R-squared (adjusted R2): Adjusted R-squared is an extension of R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors (independent variables) in the model. It penalizes the inclusion of unnecessary variables, preventing overfitting. It also ranges from 0 to 1, and higher values indicate a better fit.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Use Cases: R-squared is useful for evaluating the fit of a model, but it doesn't consider model complexity. Adjusted R-squared provides a more balanced evaluation by considering both fit and model complexity.</li>

                                <li>In linear regression, you can use R-squared to assess how well the model explains the variance in the dependent variable. Adjusted R-squared helps you choose a more parsimonious model by penalizing excessive variables.</li>

                                    <li>Steps: The elbow method involves the following steps:</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Batch Size: In BGD, the entire training dataset is used to compute the gradient of the loss function at each iteration. In contrast, SGD uses only one randomly chosen data point (or a small random batch) at a time for the gradient computation.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Convergence: BGD typically converges to the optimum more smoothly because it computes gradients using the full dataset. SGD's updates are noisy and have more variance, which can lead to faster convergence but with oscillations.</li>

                                    <li>Learning Rate: SGD often requires a smaller learning rate than BGD because of its higher variance. A smaller learning rate helps stabilize SGD updates.</li>

                                    <li>Parallelization: BGD is less parallelizable as it requires the entire dataset at each iteration. SGD, on the other hand, can take advantage of parallelism, especially in distributed computing environments.</li>

                                    <li>1. Introducing Non-Linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the model. Without non-linearity, a neural network with multiple layers would behave like a single-layer perceptron, limiting its ability to capture complex patterns in data.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>2. Enabling Complex Representations: Non-linear activation functions allow neural networks to represent and learn complex, hierarchical features in the data. This enables them to model intricate relationships and make accurate predictions.</li>

                                    <li>3. Handling Variability: Activation functions make neural networks robust to variations in data and help them adapt to different input patterns by learning appropriate transformations.</li>

                                    <li>4. Output Range Control: Different activation functions have different output ranges, which can be advantageous. For example, sigmoid functions output values between 0 and 1, making them suitable for binary classification, while ReLU functions output values in the range [0, ∞), often leading to faster convergence.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>5. Gradient Computation: Activation functions are differentiable, allowing gradient-based optimization algorithms like backpropagation to adjust network weights during training. This is crucial for learning.</li>

                                    <li>Bias: Bias represents the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. High bias leads to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture underlying patterns.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Variance: Variance represents the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data. High variance leads to overfitting, where the model fits the training data noise.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Trade-Off: The trade-off involves finding the right level of model complexity. Increasing model complexity (e.g., adding more features or making the model deeper) reduces bias but increases variance. Decreasing complexity increases bias but reduces variance.</li>

                                    <li>Data Model: SQL databases are relational and use tables with predefined schemas. NoSQL databases are non-relational and can use various data models like document, key-value, column-family, or graph.</li>

                                    <li>Scaling: SQL databases are typically scaled vertically (adding more resources to a single server), while NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scaling (adding more servers to distribute data).</li>

                                    <li>1. Margin Maximization: SVM aims to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points of each class, known as support vectors.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>2. Support Vectors: Support vectors are critical data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane). These points have the smallest margin and play a crucial role in defining the optimal hyperplane.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>3. Kernel Trick: SVM can handle non-linearly separable data by mapping it to a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function. In this higher-dimensional space, a linear hyperplane can separate the data, allowing SVM to capture complex decision boundaries.</li>

                                    <li>4. Regularization Parameter: SVM introduces a regularization parameter (C) that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors. A smaller C value leads to a larger margin but may allow some misclassification, while a larger C value reduces the margin to avoid misclassification.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>5. Versatility: SVM can be used for both binary and multi-class classification tasks and can also be applied to regression problems (Support Vector Regression, SVR).</li>

                                    <li>Purpose: One-hot encoding is used when dealing with categorical variables in machine learning models that require numerical inputs. It prevents the model from misinterpreting ordinal or nominal categories as having meaningful numerical relationships.</li>

                                    <li>Example: If you have a 'Color' feature with categories 'Red,' 'Green,' and 'Blue,' one-hot encoding would represent them as [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1], respectively.</li>

                                    <li>Sparse Data: One-hot encoding can result in sparse data, especially when dealing with high-cardinality categorical variables. In such cases, techniques like feature hashing may be considered.</li>

                                    <li>Dropout randomly deactivates (sets to zero) a fraction of neurons during each training iteration. This means that during forward and backward passes, some neurons do not contribute to the computation.</li>

                                    <li>Ensemble Effect: Dropout can be viewed as an ensemble technique, as it trains multiple subnetworks with different sets of neurons active. During inference, the predictions of these subnetworks are averaged or combined.</li>

                                    <li>Correlation: Correlation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, where a change in one variable is associated with a change in another. It quantifies the degree and direction of this association, usually expressed as a correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r). Correlation does not imply causation.</li>

                                    <li>Causation: Causation, on the other hand, implies a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables. It suggests that changes in one variable directly cause changes in another. Establishing causation often requires controlled experiments and evidence of a mechanism.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>Examples: A classic example is the correlation between ice cream sales and drowning deaths, which are positively correlated due to a common cause (hot weather). Causation would imply that eating ice cream causes drownings, which is not true.</li>

                                    <li>Purpose: Model validation helps detect issues like overfitting (where the model fits the training data too closely but performs poorly on new data) or underfitting (where the model is too simple to capture the data's complexity).</li>

                                    <li>Batch Learning: In batch learning, the model is trained on the entire dataset at once. It processes the entire dataset and updates its parameters only after seeing all the data points.</li>

                                    <li>Purpose: The primary purpose of early stopping is to prevent overfitting, where the model starts memorizing the training data rather than generalizing from it.</li>

                                    <li>Stopping Criterion: Early stopping relies on a stopping criterion, such as an increase in validation loss or a decrease in validation accuracy, to halt training.</li>

                                    <li>Benefits: It helps save training time and resources by avoiding unnecessary epochs, reduces the risk of overfitting, and produces a model that generalizes better to unseen data.</li>

                                <li>In natural language processing tasks like text classification, early stopping helps ensure that the model is not overly tuned to the training dataset's idiosyncrasies.</li>
